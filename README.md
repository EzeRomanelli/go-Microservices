# go-Microservices

This is my Go Microservices Repo. 

It was built using:
* go-chi (Middleware, Routing and Cors)
* MongoDB
* rabbitMQ
* Mailhog 
* Go Templates
* Authentication by Password/Username using PostgreSQL
* Docker
* RPC
* gRPC
* Kubernetes (Coming Soon)
* Docker Swarm (Coming Soon)

To run and test the application, simply clone the repo and go into the project directory, and run make up_build (to trigger the docker build)
, then run make start (to start the frontend)

By default, the frontend is going to be deployed at port :80, on localhost.

Any feedback is appreciated!
